This is my HelixLabs final project!


My name is Fajcsi BÃ¡lint, 25 year old guy, who started learning programming in 2020, february at HelixLabs, in hopes of changing my carrier for good. So far i have became good friends with HTML, CSS, SCSS and i'm still getting to know JavaScript. At HelixLabs the final exam, is a project, which you have to make from scarps, using angular. The main features it has to maintain are being able to sign-up/sign-in/sign-out, and basic CRUD functions. I used angular + firebase instead of a fakebackend, for my app. My app has a drumkit (which doesn't work properly, it should transition out too after pressing a key), a basic ToDo list (CRUD with firebase database) and even an option to reset your password.

I hope you will like my first webapp, if you have any tips for the app then please don't hold it in!
